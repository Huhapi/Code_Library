Hello!

I Created three different play options which are in separate files, PlayRNGComputer, UploadPGN, and ChessRecordGame

I was planning on encorporating them all into one program at some point but this is where I stopped.
In order to run each program, There is a spot on line 95 of the Play file(file used to run the program) where the current 
file location of the piece images needs to be updated to where that folder "images" is on your computer.
